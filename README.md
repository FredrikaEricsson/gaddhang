# Gaddhang

Gäddhäng (Roghly translated to Pike club) is a fictional association for kids who wants to learn more about fishing.

Did a campaign site and put a lot of focus on the graphical design and the layout. Wanted to try to work with grid instead of flex for the first time, and also try to practice accessability in web design. Also experimented with animation using Greensock.

All of the graphcal elements were created in Illustrator and Procreate by yours truly and I'm very happy with the result!
